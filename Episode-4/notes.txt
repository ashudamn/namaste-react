What will you do when someone gives task to build an app?
Firstly you will mock design that app.
You will have to do planning.
What is needed inside planning
1. What you are going to build ?
2. How the app is going to look Wireframe ,UI mock?

our App component
contains 3 parts
Header
Body 
Footer

An component is nothing but a js function returns JSX.

A header component contains
-Logo
-Nav items

Body component contains
-Search
-Restaurant container
-Restaurant Card

Footer
-Copyright
-Links
-Address
-Contact

We are using restaurnat card a lot,
so we will build a common restaurant card component to maintain re-usability.

inline style in react 
const styleObject={
    backgroundColor:'yellow'
}

<component style={styleObject} />
style={} means we are writing js inside curly braces

Passing arguments to function is similar to passing props to a component
const {prop1,prop2} = props //destructuring an Object

Config-Driven UI 
UI is based on configuration of the location,user and filters 
controlling the ui using data and config that comes from backend.

When writing production ready code  we have to write re-usable component

Each child in the list should have unique key property warning
-> but why it needs unique key
-> so that react knows to identify each component uniquely to optimize rendering
-> without that react will render list again and again after any new changes
-> benefit of unique id is , it help react idenitify what is new and what is old item in list 
-> so render cycles are less 

why we should not use index as key
because the order of items may change 
[0,1,2,3,4,5]
new list [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

using keys is good practice in react.

unique key >>>>>>>>>>> index(it is last resort)
