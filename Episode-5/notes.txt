Everything that react can do , can be done by normal css java-script.
Then why react :);
UI library/framework helps in development and optimization.

Place your files inside components folder and util folder.
React never forces you to do this , you can have your own folder structure.
You can use .js ans .jsx extension, hardly matters.

While making different components, you have to make that component file
Write the component structure and export the component/function
Then you can import that function to use it in your app.js file or respective file.
first export and then import 

You should keep constants in a separate file.
constants should have SNAKE_CASE format

same with constant json, make separate file for that

multiple export, default export-> there could be only one default export.
named export to export multiple export.

export default component
import component from "path";

export const name-some
import {name-same} from "path";

try to do both named and default export.

One of the react super power is the UI layer and Data layer works with each other tightly.
Updating DOM manipulation.

State variable using hooks

A react hook is normal js function, it comes with some utilities.
Written by facebook functions.

hooks
useState()
useEffect()
--most important hooks

import {useState} from "react"

whenever a state variable changes , react re-rendering components

const arr = useState(0);
const [list,setList] = arr;// array destructuring
go to react fibre and understand.
