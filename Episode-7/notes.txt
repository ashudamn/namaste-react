useEffect is called with two things dependency array and function to run

useEffect called after every renders without any dependency array
useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("on every render");
});

If the dependency array is empty then useEffect is called on initial render 
useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("");
},[]);

If we have a dependency array then useEffect will be called on change of that dependency

useEffect(()=>{
    console.log("");
},[urlResourceId]);


useState 

whenever use useState call it inside component body.
Used for creating local state variables.
Call it on top, as JS runs line by line.
Do not create useState hooks inside if-else.
XXXXXXX
if(){
    const [state,setState] = useState();
}
XXXXXXX
 Do not create inside for loop;

 No we are creating routes in the application.
 we will use the library react-router-dom

 First we have to import createBrowserRouter from react-router-dom
 We have to create routing configuration in root level component 
 in our case it is App.js 

 Configuration is nothing but, what will happen on a specific route.

 rafc in vs code to create component 

 create error route in configuration in react-router-dom configuration.
 
 Children routes for routes under App.js
and Link route as anchor tag causes the page to refresh on visiting a new link with hyperlink

Server side routing is when new html is loaded when visiting a particular route.
